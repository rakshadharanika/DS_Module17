# Ex24 Shortest Path and Reachability in a Heritage Town using BFS
## DATE:
## AIM:
To design and implement a java program that, given a map of attractions in a heritage town connected by walking paths, recommends:
The shortest number of paths (minimum hops) from a starting attraction to a target attraction.
The number of reachable attractions from the same starting point using Breadth-First Search (BFS)

## Output:



## Result:
The program has been successfully implemented and executed.
It correctly computes:
The shortest number of paths (minimum hops) between two attractions.
The total number of reachable attractions from a given starting point using BFS traversal.
